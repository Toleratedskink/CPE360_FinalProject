# CPE360_FinalProject
Turn your model airplane into a realistic one

This project was inspired by the interest of making an RC airplane from scratch. Since I didn't have the tools to make an RC airplane I made a model airplane with the same controls to demonstrate the concept. Using the ATMEGA328PB Microcontroller, a DC motor, an 16x2 LCD Module, and 2 servos I create a realistic plane. I used c as the main code and create drivers for the different devices added to the project (servo, motor, etc.). This project was for my Microprocessors II class where we learned embedded c programming.
